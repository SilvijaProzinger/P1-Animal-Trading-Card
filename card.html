			The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), largest of the true foxes, has the greatest geographic range of all members of the Carnivora order,
			being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere. Red foxes are usually together in pairs or small groups consisting of families.
			Red foxes have binocular vision, but their sight reacts mainly to movement. They have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds 
			spanning five octaves.
